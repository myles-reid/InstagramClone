@model DirectMessage

@*
	Add In here all previous messages between two UserIDS. This will have to 
	be a query finding all messages between the same two users

	Probably have a foreach loop where each message has the userID of both in either position.

	The User that is viewing the messages will be on the right, with the other on the left

	This will use a partial view to display the messages - Not complicated, basically just a <p> tag
*@
<div>
	@foreach (DirectMessage message in ViewBag.Messages) { @*Will have to change from Viewbags*@
		<partial name="_Message" model="message" />
	}
</div>

<form asp-action="SendMessage">
	<div class="form-group">
		<label asp-for="MessageText" class="lead"><strong>Message</strong></label>
		<textarea asp-for="MessageText" class="form-control"></textarea>
	</div>
	<button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Send</button>
